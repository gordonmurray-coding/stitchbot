StitchBot directly attacks the single biggest practical weakness of high-throughput BlockDAGs like Kaspa: topological fragility under load.
It does this with an extremely lightweight, incentive-compatible mechanism that is provably effective, economically rational, and future-proof across all known Kaspa consensus upgrades (GHOSTDAG → DAGKnight). The core problem being topological high throughput stress fractures. Security and liveliness in a blockDag are governed by bluescore convergence, under a so-called poisson process. A fracture is two high blue score blocks that are mutually within eachothers anticone (not yet ordered). The probability of deep reorgs grows with time at an exponential rate with the width (the number of parallel high blue scoring tips) and duration of the fracture. [Sompolinsky, Zohar, Wyborsky: “The security threshold degrades gracefully with the degree of parallelism… the higher the honest throughput relative to the adversary, the larger the tolerated parallelism.”] Fractures waste honest work and create SPV deception vectors, which will ultimately impact the so-called normie market, truly a disaster. 

Stitchbot detects a fracturing of the dag (an anomaly of high-betweenness nodes with large blue delta scores), broadcasts a signed p2p request to reference both tips for a modest reward, incentivizing timely reconvergence of the dag. Note, this is not a consensus change per say, but rather an economic consideration.

From ghostDag theorem 1 (security against balance attacks): "The probability that an attacker can create a violating chain of length ℓ is bounded by exp(−ℓ² / (2 · λ · T)) where λ is honest throughput and T is network delay." Fractures increase effective T because honest blocks are spread across parallel tips. Miners are rational profit maximizers. A miner sees the cost of adding an extra parent {~0 ( bandwidth + extra header hash ) & the modest reward upon inclusion }. Every miner who recieves the p2p request will include both parents if the reward is greater than the cost of missing it. Miners already build on multiple parents aggressively, so why not prioritize the right ones at the right times.

A wider dag induces more sybil/partition attack surface areas, a relatively narrow enough dag means fewer paths leading to reduced SPV attack effectivity and indeed the dagKnight protocol is concerned with this problem. 
Let W = average tip width, D = average fracture duration.
Reorg probability ≈ exp(−c · blue_score / (W · D)) for some constant c.
StitchBot reduces W

**A full P2P DAG healer for Kaspa**  
Detects topological fractures → broadcasts stitch requests → pays miners to heal the network.

**Zero on-chain footprint. Sub-second healing. Secure by default.**
